      <description>Another inference post. I imagine there will be many more of these.
What variables affect deep NN prediction? Sensitivity Analysis was purposed by Kewley et al. (2000) to answer this question. Here&amp;rsquo;s the gist:
After fitting a model, in this case a deep NN, use the average of every feature for prediction. To test the model&amp;rsquo;s sensitivity to a specific feature, iterate over a range and make predictions at each point, while keeping all other features at their average level.</description>

      <description>Prediction is cool, useful, and good. I, for some reason, am not impressed by it, especially with continuous outcomes. Every time I fit a Deep NN, XGBoost, LASSO, Random Forest, etc. I am left empty. My MSE is incredibly low. Hurray. Why is this the case? What variables are important? To what degree is each imput important?
I understand the different goals of inference &amp;amp; prediction, but these methods are so powerful; they must be holding important information!</description>
